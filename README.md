# UFOs
  Challenge 11

## Project Overview
Dana is creating a webpage about UFO's - one of her favorite subjects. After a synposis on UFO sightings, the webpage features a filterable table that pulls data on sightings. Using html and javaScript, I helped her create the webpage and pull in the data. Initially, she requested the table be filterable by date and now whe wants a more in depth analysis. She requested I add filters for city, state, country, and shape. Asking for user input and allowing the user to pull more data that fits their criteria. Below is walk through of the funcitonality of the webpage.

## Results
The main purpose of the webpage is to filter data by the users preferred criteria but it of course starts with bit more information. As the webpage loads up you see the header behind an image of Earth's atmosphere.

As the user scrolls, they come to a brief 4 paragraph write-up on UFO sightings being fact or fiction before the dive into their search. 

When the search function is blank, the webpage shows every point of data and the filter fields are blank besides for the example searches. Having suggested searches shows the user what type of syntax to use while searching. For example, the data is in lower case so the user must search using lower case. Additionally, the state and country variables use short-hand; United States is us and California is ca. Thefore, the user needs to apply the same case when searching.
